1.Dataset Overview
The Titanic dataset is used to analyze passenger information (like age, sex, class, etc.) to determine survival patterns. Initial steps include loading the dataset and inspecting it using .info(), .describe(), and .value_counts() to understand structure, summary stats, and categorical distributions.

2.Data Cleaning & Preparation
Missing values are identified and handled appropriately. Categorical features are encoded, and numerical features are scaled or transformed if needed. Key variables like Survived, Sex, Pclass, Age, and Fare are retained for analysis.

3.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualizations using sns.pairplot() and sns.heatmap() are created to observe correlations and feature interactions. Histograms, boxplots, and scatterplots are plotted to examine distributions and outliers.

4.Trend Identification
Relationships between survival and features like Sex, Pclass, Age, and Fare are analyzed. For example, survival is higher for women and passengers in higher classes.

5.Observations
For each visual, concise observations are written. E.g., "Females had a higher survival rate compared to males", or "Passengers in Pclass 1 had better chances of survival."

6.Summary of Findings
The final section summarizes insights like key survival predictors, feature importance, and any discovered trends, helping build a foundation for further predictive modeling or reporting.
